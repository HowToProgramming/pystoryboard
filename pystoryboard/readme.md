## ChatGPT To-dos

- [x] **Timeline and Keyframe Animation**: A timeline interface allows users to create and manage animation sequences. Keyframe functionality enables users to set specific values for properties at different points in time.

- [ ] **Layer-Based Editing**: Support for multiple layers allows users to organize and control various elements independently. Layers provide flexibility and ease in managing complex compositions.

- [ ] **Pre-built Templates and Effects**: Include a library of pre-designed templates, transitions, and effects to help users get started quickly and enhance their projects.

- [ ] **Text and Typography Tools**: Provide tools for creating and animating text, such as text editing capabilities, font selection, kerning, tracking, and text animation presets.

- [ ] **Shape and Object Manipulation**: Enable users to create and animate geometric shapes, vectors, and other graphical objects. This includes features like scaling, rotating, skewing, and masking.

- [x] **Import and Export Options**: Allow users to import media files such as images, videos, and audio. Support popular file formats for both import and export, ensuring compatibility with other software and platforms.

- [ ] **Particle Systems and Dynamics**: Include tools for creating particle-based effects like fire, smoke, rain, or other dynamic simulations to enhance visual appeal.

- [ ] **Integration with 3D Software**: If feasible, consider integrating 3D capabilities or provide support for importing 3D models, enabling users to combine 2D and 3D elements seamlessly.

- [x] **Export and Rendering Options**: Offer a range of export options to various video formats and codecs. Users should be able to customize resolution, frame rate, and compression settings for optimal output.

- [ ] **Project Management and Version Control**: Implement features that allow users to manage and organize their projects effectively, including the ability to save versions, collaborate, and revert changes if needed.

- [ ] **GPU Acceleration**: Utilize hardware acceleration to improve performance and real-time playback, especially for complex compositions and high-resolution projects.

- [ ] **Tutorials and Help Documentation**: Provide comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and tooltips to help users understand the tool's features and capabilities.
